Compiere Subscription Agreement

PLEASE READ THIS COMPIERE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT BEFORE PURCHASING OR USING THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES. BY USING OR PURCHASING THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, CUSTOMER SIGNIFIES ITS ASSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU ARE ACTING ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, THEN YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF THAT ENTITY. IF CUSTOMER DOES NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THEN IT MUST NOT PURCHASE OR USE THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES.
THIS COMPIERE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ALL EXHIBITS ("AGREEMENT"), IS BETWEEN COMPIERE, INC. ("COMPIERE") AND THE PURCHASER OR USER OF COMPIERE SERVICES THAT ACCEPTS THE TERMS OF THIS COMPIERE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT ("CUSTOMER"). THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT ("EFFECTIVE DATE") IS THE EARLIER OF THE DATE THAT CUSTOMER ACCEPTS THIS AGREEMENT BY ENTERING INTO AN ORDER FORM OR THE DATE THAT CUSTOMER USES COMPIERE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES. ALL SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES ARE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  ALL CAPITALIZED TERMS WILL BE AS DEFINED IN SECTION 14.
 
1.	Support Services.    
(a)	During the Subscription Period, Compiere will provide the Support Services for the Authorized Users based on the Subscription Edition selected on the Order Form. If the number of Users exceeds the number of Authorized Users, Customer must promptly provide a written report to Compiere of the number of actual Users who are not Authorized Users and pay the relevant fee to enable all Users to become Authorized Users. Customer will be responsible for any act or omission of Customer’s Authorized Users and their compliance with all of the terms of this Agreement.  Any action or breach of the terms of this Agreement by any of Customer’s Users will be deemed an action or breach by Customer.  
(b)	Support Services will be provided only on unmodified versions of the Product. Each Compiere Subscription Agreement and License covers one System and additional fees will be due for each additional System. Compiere will use reasonable commercial efforts to respond to the Support Request within the Response Time in Table 1 of the Agreement for the applicable Subscription Edition selected. Compiere warrants that the Support Services will be performed with reasonable care and skill. If Customer believes that the Support Services have not met this standard, Customer will promptly report such failure to Compiere (but in any case no later than thirty (30) days after such failure). Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, and Compiere’s entire liability for a failure of the foregoing warranty, will be for Compiere to promptly re-perform the Support Services free of charge so that it conforms to the warranty in this Section.   
(c)	EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 1, COMPIERE PROVIDES THE SUPPORT SERVICES AND PRODUCT TO CUSTOMER AND THE AUTHORIZED USERS “AS IS.”  COMPIERE  DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, AND ALL WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. 
(d) Customer agrees that as a condition of Compiere’s providing the Support Services, Customer:  
    (i)  will migrate to the most current version of the Product at least once per year using the Compiere Version Migration Services to enable Compiere to provide effective ongoing support. Support Services will only be provided for the most recent Version of the Product. 
    (ii)  acknowledges that the Product includes modules that report the number of Users and enable Compiere to monitor certain usage of the Product ("Auxiliary Software") which is fundamental to the business of Compiere. Notwithstanding any other agreement, neither Customer nor Customer’s Users may modify or remove any portion of the Auxiliary Software. The violation of this prohibition will be deemed a material breach of this Agreement and Compiere may immediately terminate this Agreement.  
	(iii)  will not fork any version of, or offer or promote any forked version of, any software product released by Compiere including the Product. "Forking" means to bifurcate the source code for the software into a separately maintained source code repository for the purpose of creating a competing new software product. 
    (iv)  will not provide hosting, time-sharing or similar services for third parties (support for such services are available under a separate Hosting Services Agreement).
2.	Support Requests. 
(a) Before submitting any Support Request to Compiere, Customer agrees to review the Documentation, try to replicate the Error in an unmodified version of the latest release of the Product, and research other support requests and bug reports available at www.compiere.com/support/support-requests.php. If Customer has modified the Product, Customer must inform Compiere about the nature and extent of the modifications. Compiere may elect to provide Customer with support for Errors which are due to Customer’s modification of the Product subject to the payment of a Support Request fee of $150 per hour on the terms in Section 6(d) whether or not Customer has used Customer’s allocation of Support Requests for such term and regardless of which edition of the Software the Customer has subscribed to.  
(b) The Authorized Representatives must have received training on the Product prior to their appointment as an Authorized Representative.  
3.	License Grant. The Product is licensed to the Customer under the terms of Exhibit 1 of the Agreement.
4.	Disclaimer of Consequential Damages  NEITHER COMPIERE NOR ITS LICENSORS WILL BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR DAMAGES ARISING FROM LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF CONTENT OR LOSS OF DATA, REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL THEORY ON WHICH SUCH DAMAGES MAY BE BASED, AND EVEN IF COMPIERE OR ITS LICENSORS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES 
5.	Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT WILL COMPIERE’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.  
6.	Fees.  
(a) In consideration of the Support Services and the other obligations of Compiere hereunder, Customer agrees to pay Compiere applicable fees for the number Authorized Users of the Product set forth on the Order Form. Compiere will not provide any Support Services until it receives payment from Customer of the initial fees due. Such fees will be due for Renewal Terms, thirty (30) days prior to the commencement of the Renewal Term. All payments due are in U.S. dollars in advance unless otherwise indicated on the Order Form. The failure to pay the appropriate fees when due is cause for termination of this Agreement.
(b) Compiere may modify the fee schedule and other terms of this Agreement and such changes will only be effective during the relevant Renewal Term.  
(c) Customer may add more Authorized Users, subject to the payment of the applicable fees; provided that any payments during the term of a Subscription Period will be pro rated for the period between the date the User first obtained access (“First Access Date”) to the Product and the rest of the current Initial Term or Renewal Term. However, if such payment is not made within thirty (30) days after the First Access Date, Customer will pay an additional late fee of 20% of the amount due.
(d) If applicable, Customer will pay Compiere the additional Support Request fee within thirty (30) days after the use of a Support Request which exceeds the allocation of Support Requests for Customer’s level of Support Services in Table 1. 
(e) Interest will accrue on late or delinquent payments at one-and-one-half percent (1.5%) per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, whichever is lower) from the due date until the date paid in full.  Customer will be responsible for all expenses (including attorneys' fees) Compiere incurs in collecting undisputed late, unpaid or delinquent amounts.  
(g) Customer will also pay all taxes, including sales, use, personal property, value-added, excise, customs fees, import duties, stamp duties and any other similar taxes and duties, including penalties and interest, imposed by any United States federal, state, provincial or local government entity or any non-US government entity on the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, excluding taxes based upon Compiere’s net income. If any applicable law requires Customer to withhold amounts from any payments to Compiere under this Agreement, (a) Customer will effect such withholding, remit such amounts to the appropriate taxing authorities and promptly furnish Compiere with tax receipts evidencing the payments of such amounts and (b) the sum payable by Customer upon which the deduction or withholding is based will be increased to the extent necessary to ensure that, after such deduction or withholding, Compiere receives and retains, free from liability for such deduction or withholding, a net amount equal to the amount Compiere would have received and retained absent the required deduction or withholding.
(h) At Compiere’s request, but in no event more than twice per year, and upon reasonable prior notice, Compiere may audit Customer’s usage and records to ensure that Customer is using the Products and/or Support Services in compliance with this Agreement.  Any such audit will be conducted during regular business hours at Customer’s offices and will not interfere unreasonably with Customer’s business activities.  If an audit reveals that Customer has underpaid Customer’s total fees (for example, by reason of Customer’s use of more Authorized Users than Customer has paid for) by more than five percent (5%), then Customer will pay Compiere's reasonable costs of conducting the audit, in addition to the underpaid amount.  Compiere will have the right to report the results of any such audit to Third-Party Software licensors.
7.	Term and Termination 
(a) This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date and will continue for the Initial Term and will automatically renew for additional Renewal Terms on the terms of the then most current version of the Compiere Subscription Agreement as provided on the Compiere website, unless a party has provided notice to the other party of its intent not to renew at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current Term.  Customer may terminate this Agreement at any time, but, Customer will not receive any refund of fees paid.    
(b) Compiere may terminate this Agreement on thirty (30) days written notice if Customer breaches any term of this Agreement, unless such breach is cured by Customer within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice thereof.  
(c) Customer may upgrade to the Enterprise Edition or Professional Edition by giving written notice to Compiere and paying the fee set by Compiere for the Enterprise Edition or Professional Edition for the number of Authorized Users.  Unless Customer gives written notice at the time of renewal of the Agreement that it is changing its Subscription Edition, the Subscription Edition for the Renewal Term will be the same as the prior term.  
(d) Upon termination, Customer’s rights under this Agreement will terminate. If Customer terminates this Agreement and later elects to enter into a new subscription agreement, then Customer may be required to pay a reasonable reinstatement fee to be determined by Compiere.  
(e) The following sections will survive termination:  1(c), 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14.

9.	Mutual Confidentiality.

The party receiving the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party (the “Receiving Party”) will only use the Confidential Information to perform its obligations under this Agreement and agrees not disclose or cause to be disclosed any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, except (a) to those employees of the Receiving Party who require access to the Confidential Information to perform under this Agreement and who are bound by written agreement not to disclose third-party confidential or proprietary information disclosed to such party, or (b) as such disclosure may be required by law or governmental regulation, subject to the Receiving Party providing to the Disclosing Party written notice to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or otherwise prevent the disclosure. Nothing in this Agreement will prohibit or limit either party’s use of information (a) previously known to it without obligation of confidence, (b) independently developed by or for it without use of or access to the other party’s Confidential Information, (c) acquired by it from a third party which is not under an obligation of confidence with respect to such information, or (d) which is or becomes publicly available through no breach of this Agreement.  Each party acknowledges that damages for improper disclosure of Confidential Information may be irreparable; therefore, the injured party is entitled to seek equitable relief, including temporary restraining order(s) or a preliminary or permanent injunction, in addition to all other remedies, for any violation or threatened violation of this Section.  Within five (5) days after a Disclosing Party’s request, the Receiving Party will return or destroy the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.  If there is any conflict between this Section 8 and a separate non-disclosure agreement entered by the parties, this Agreement will control.
10.	Contribution.  If Customer, Customer’s employees, contractors or Affiliates contribute to the Products by sharing or providing requirements, design, code, documentation or procedures, or if Customer identified and/or fixed a bug in the Products, all intellectual property will be Compiere’s and Customer agrees that it is contributing Customer’s requirements, design, code, documentation or procedures or bug fixs to Compiere through the Compiere Contributor Agreement in its current version on Compiere’s website at http://www.compiere.com/terms/contributor-agreement.pdf  and by entering into this Agreement, Customer agrees to the terms and conditions of the Compiere Contributor Agreement.

12.	Non-Assertion.  Customer irrevocably covenants and agrees on behalf of itself and Customer’s successors and assigns not to Assert against Compiere and its licensees, both direct and indirect, including without limitation, its distributors and end users, any claim that any products or services developed or distributed by Compiere infringes or misappropriates any intellectual property right owned or exclusively licensed by Customer or any of its affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing covenant precludes any suits or assertions against Compiere under a theory of infringement or misappropriation, or any similar theory based on Compiere and its licensees, both direct and indirect, including without limitation, its distributors and end users’, sale, distribution or use of products or services developed or distributed by Compiere.  
13.	General.  Except as expressly provided herein, Customer may not assign Customer’s rights or delegate Customer’s obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent of Compiere, except to the surviving entity in a merger or consolidation of Customer or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Customer’s assets and such surviving entity or purchaser expressly assumes this Agreement in writing.  This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the federal U.S. laws applicable therein, excluding its conflicts of law provisions, and Customer and Compiere agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in San Mateo, California. The parties agree that neither the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods nor the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act will apply to this Agreement.  The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision hereof will not affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor will the waiver by either party of a breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself.  If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision.  In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any license agreements appearing with or in the software products comprising the Products, this Agreement will prevail.  This Agreement and the documents referenced in this Agreement, constitute the entire agreement between Customer and Compiere relating to its subject matter and all terms herein and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings.
